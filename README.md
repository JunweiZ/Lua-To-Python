# Lua to Python

This is a project where I attempt to convert Lua to Python, by transforming Lua into Python AST and then running it.


## Current status
- Variable assignments, basic datatypes and comparisons, if statements, while loops and functions are working.


## Getting started

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```
Usage: compile.py [OPTIONS] SOURCE_FILE

Options:
  --strip_comments INTEGER  Remove comments from tokens
  --tokens INTEGER          Show tokens generated by lexer
  --ast INTEGER             Show the internal AST (later transformed to Python
                            AST
  --py_ast INTEGER          Show Python AST
  --py_code INTEGER         Show generated Python code
  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

Example: `./compile.py --strip-comments=1 examples/functions.lua`
